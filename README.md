# IPython-extensions

Hello IPythonista, 

You have a small extension for IPython, and you want it to be more visible ?
You can request it to be hosted here. We will be happy to count you in the organisation. 

Our goal is to make small extension easy to find, so for 1 line extension we created this repo. 
That make it easier to maintain and respond to issues that going through N repository hosted by M user
and where you never remember where is what. 

If you have a bigger extension and whant it on it's own repo, it's ok too,
we can create teh repo  and give you admin right. 

One thing we want to avoid is project being abandoned by their author without a way
to update the readme, or give contribution access to people interested. 

So if you contribute an extension there, and just go away we won't mind, and if a extension is
abandonned and want to adopt it, the res of the organisation can give you write access to update it. 

This is roughly base on how https://github.com/ipython-contrib/IPython-notebook-extensions works
and we should be more explicit there too. 

Also we are not officially afiliated with IPython itself, we have much lower code standard, 
and will give you commit right much more easily.
